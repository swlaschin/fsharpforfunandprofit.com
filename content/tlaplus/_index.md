This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "TLA+ for programmers: Building confidence in concurrent code using a model checker".

Here's the blurb for the talk:

> As developers, we have a number of well-known practices to ensure code quality,
> such as unit tests, code review and so on. But these practices often break down
> when we need to design concurrent systems. Often, there can be subtle and serious
> bugs that are not found with conventional practices.
> \
> \
> But there’s another approach that you can use -- model-checking -- that can detect
> potential concurrency errors at design time, and so dramatically increase your
> confidence in your code. In this talk, I’ll demonstrate and demystify TLA+,
> a powerful design and model-checking system. We’ll see how it can check your
> concurrent designs for errors, saving you time up front and frustration later!
