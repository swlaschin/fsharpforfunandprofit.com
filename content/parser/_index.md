This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Understanding parser combinators".

Here's the blurb for the talk:


> Traditionally, writing parsers has been hard, involving arcane tools like Lex and Yacc.
> An alternative approach is to write a parser in your favourite programming language,
> using a "parser combinator" library and concepts no more complicated than regular expressions.
> \
> \
> In this talk, we'll do a deep dive into parser combinators.
> We'll build a parser combinator library from scratch in F# using functional programming techniques,
> and then use it to implement a full featured JSON parser.
