So you're all excited about functional programming, and you've been learning F# in your spare time,
and you're annoying your co-workers by ranting about how great it is, and you're itching to use it for serious stuff at work...

But then you hit a brick wall. 

Your workplace has a "C# only" policy and won't let you use F#. 

If you work in a typical enterprise environment, getting a new language approved will be a long drawn out process,
involving persuading your teammates, the QA guys, the ops guys, your boss, your boss's boss, and the [mysterious bloke down the hall](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html) who you've never talked to.
I would encourage you to start that process (a [helpful link for your manager](http://fpbridge.co.uk/why-fsharp.html)), but still, you're impatient and thinking "what can I do now?"

On the other hand, perhaps you work in a flexible, easy going place, where you can do what you like.

But you're conscientious, and don't want to be one of those people who re-write some mission critical system in APL, and then vanish without trace, leaving
your replacement some mind-bendingly cryptic code to maintain.
No, you want to make sure that you are not doing anything that will affect your team's [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

So in both these scenarios, you want to use F# at work, but you can't (or don't want to) use it for core application code.

What can you do? 

Well, don't worry! This series will suggest a number of ways you can get your hands dirty with F# in a low-risk, incremental way, without affecting any mission critical code.
